A simple DIY laser range finder.

This is a very simple DIY laser range finder. For fast prototyping, I uses a Raspberry Pi 1 board with a web cam, a cheap laser diode (<5mW, I think) and some 3d printed bars to align the parts.

**src** - *all source code*

**eltr** - *all electric/electronic stuffs*

**model** - *all models of frame, mount, ... that would be 3d printed*
